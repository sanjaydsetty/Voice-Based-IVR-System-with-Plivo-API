# Voice-Based IVR System with Plivo API

This project is a **multi-level Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system** built using **Plivo’s Voice API**. It demonstrates outbound call initiation, DTMF-based user input handling, dynamic call flow branching, and call forwarding to a live agent — all controlled via a simple web interface.

The goal of this project is to showcase real-world API integration, backend call logic, webhook handling, and frontend interaction in a clean and scalable way.
